## README

The documentation that is needed for the construction of the PI Ventilator.

Currently only the mechnical part of the machine is put as open-source.

**3dmodel:**  
Full model of the PI Ventilator

**BOM folder:**
Contains the preliminary bill of materials

**drawings:**  
Technical drawings of the PI Ventilator  

**research folder:**  
Experimental evaluation of the PI Ventilator

**Manuals:**
Contains the manuals of the device, at this moment this contains the mechanical assembly manual and the user manual.
