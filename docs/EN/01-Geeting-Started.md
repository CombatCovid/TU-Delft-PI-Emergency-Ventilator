# Getting started
1. Read the readme file in the main folder and the 'device_evaluation.pdf' (at [src/research](../../src/research)).
2. Open 'Project_Inspiration_Vx.x.STEP' (at [src/3dmodel](../../src/3dmodel)) to familiarize with the mechanical design of the machine. Note that the machine relies on external oxygen supply and preferably a third party humidifier.*
3. Open 'BOM with manufacturers and suppliers.xlsx' (at [src/BOM](../../src/BOM)). Order prefab parts and contact (local) workshop(s) to produce tailored parts.
4. Open 'Project_Inspiration_Drawings_Vx.x.zip' (at [src/drawings](../../src/drawings)) and check compatibility and send these documents to (local) workshop(s) that produce tailored parts.
5. Open the assembly manual for assembly instructions (at [src/manuals](../../src/manuals)).
6. Open the user manual to understand the working of the mechanical ventilator (at [src/manuals](../../src/manuals)).
7. Do not use the completed machine for medical use until the machine is certified by your national healthcare products regulatory agency.


\* = It might appear some subassemblies are missing because these are not yet released, not yet relevant or cancelled altogether. For example the custom humidifier (for if there is no third party humidifier available) has not been released at the time of this writing.
